KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- pretty-printing C-code: currently, the following OpenCL attributes are not
  supported: image type qualifiers: __write_only, __read_only, __read_write
- ext_vector_type does not support post- and pre- increment/decrement:
  typedef int int4 __attribute__ ((ext_vector_type(4)));
  int4 a;
  a++;
  error: cannot increment value of type 'int __attribute__((ext_vector_type(4)))'
- ternary operators cannot be overloaded, that is, there is no support for ?: on
  vector types
